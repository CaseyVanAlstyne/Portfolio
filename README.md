<!-- Adding comments for portfolio -->

Welcome to my portfolio page! 

There are three sections to my page: "About Me," "Portfolio," and "Contact Information." The page is crafted using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap 4. While the portfolio items are currently placeholders, I plan on adding functional pages to the portfolio in the coming months. 

I used the Jumbotron declaration for the "About Me" Page. Nested inside of this container is a series of rows and columns for text and images. 

For the "Portfolio" page, I used a container with multiple divs to house cards. 

The "Contact Information" page includes a form which will, in the future, recieve and store user information. 

The navigation bar at the top of the screen is found on each page and links the pages together without the use of Javascript. The footer is at a relative position toward the bottom of the page, and can also be found on each page. 

The page is responsive and features margins on each side of containers, especially when the screen size is decreased. 

This was a fun homework assignment. Thanks to Austin B., Brenden C., and Tom E. for all of their help and assistance on this homework assignment.
